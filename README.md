# GPA Console App

A C# program that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student based on their courses.

The code consists of four classes: 

1. Course,
2. Student, 
3. GPAFormatter, and 
4. Program. 

The Course class represents a single course that has a name, a credit hour, and a grade. 

The Student class represents a student that has a name and a list of courses. 

The GPAFormatter class is responsible for formatting the output of the student's GPA based on their courses. 

The Program class contains the main method that runs the program.

## Run

To run the program, you need to have a C# compiler and an editor installed on your computer. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other IDE that supports C# development.
